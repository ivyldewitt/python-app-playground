**What did I learn today?**:
Recapped some basic syntax within Python, including strings, functions,
assigning function input to variables, and string concatenation.

**How does this build on from yesterday?**:
This is my first 'official' day of the course, so it doesn't at the moment.

**Key Takeways & Points to Review**:
* The importance of strings + concatenation
* Review of functions
* Passing in string literals
* Variables and assignment

**Any Reflections?**: 

Not at the moment but I'm just getting started!
